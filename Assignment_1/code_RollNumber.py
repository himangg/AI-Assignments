# General Notes:
# - Update the provided file name (code_<RollNumber>.py) as per the instructions.
# - Do not change the function name, number of parameters or the sequence of parameters.
# - The expected output for each function is a path (list of node names)
# - Ensure that the returned path includes both the start node and the goal node, in the correct order.
# - If no valid path exists between the start and goal nodes, the function should return None.


# Algorithm: Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)

# Input:
#   - adj_matrix: Adjacency matrix representing the graph.
#   - start_node: The starting node in the graph.
#   - goal_node: The target node in the graph.

# Return:
#   - A list of node names representing the path from the start_node to the goal_node.
#   - If no path exists, the function should return None.

# Sample Test Cases:

#   Test Case 1:
#     - Start node: 1, Goal node: 2
#     - Return: [1, 7, 6, 2]

#   Test Case 2:
#     - Start node: 5, Goal node: 12
#     - Return: [5, 97, 98, 12]

#   Test Case 3:
#     - Start node: 12, Goal node: 49
#     - Return: None

#   Test Case 4:
#     - Start node: 4, Goal node: 12
#     - Return: [4, 6, 2, 9, 8, 5, 97, 98, 12]

# Bonus Problem
 
# Input:
# - adj_matrix: A 2D list or numpy array representing the adjacency matrix of the graph.

# Return:
# - A list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v.
#   These are the vulnerable roads whose removal would disconnect parts of the graph.

# Note:
# - The graph is undirected, so if an edge (u, v) is vulnerable, then (v, u) should not be repeated in the output list.
# - If the input graph has no vulnerable roads, return an empty list [].
